      <h5> About me: </h5>
        <p>
          When it comes to my artist practice I experience myself increasingly as a mixed-media person.
          I enjoy to experiment with painting, photography, digital design, printmaking, sculpture, collage/assemblage and also combined techniques.
          Re-occurring themes are symmetry, layering, transparency and a play with the viewer’s perception.
          There is a focus on repurposing / recycling in terms of the motives and materials I’m using.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was born in the Lower Rhine Valley near Duesseldorf (Germany).
          After initial professional years in the 1980-ties as a Customs Officer - at that time first exhibitions of surrealism influenced pencil / crayon drawings.
          I studied in the field of Product / Textile design at the University of Applied Science Niederrhein in Krefeld.
          Parts of my studies were drawing/painting classes and also training on the subjects of photography, textile printing and weaving. During that period further exhibitions – solo and together with fellow students - followed.
          After leaving university as Qualified Designer I worked in several companies, specializing in textile accessories and corporate fashion/work wear.
          Since early 2008 I have been living and working in New Zealand, now based in Lower Hutt.
          In my artistic work I’m venturing into a variety of techniques and materials – printmaking, photography, painting, collage, digital design and also sculpture. I am influenced by artists like Renee’ Magritte, M.C. Escher, Pierre et Gilles, Andy Warhol as well as Gilbert and George.
          <br>
          <br>
          I’m a Diploma graduate of The Learning Connexion in Lower Hutt, currently completing my Advanced Diploma studies of Art and Creativity and also a member of the Hutt Art Society and the Print-Council Aotearoa.
          My artwork is represented in private collections in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway and Germany.
