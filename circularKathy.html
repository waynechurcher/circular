      <h5> About me: </h5>
        <p><b>Favourite medium</b> – difficult to define as they all can be interchangeable and inter-incorporated into artworks. However if I have to pick it would be sculpting with oil based clay and jewellery in silver (wish it was gold, but can’t afford to explore that yet).
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>My art story</b>  - Who am I? I am broke but very happy!
            <br>
            <br>
            I have always been the creative type of person and I enjoy exploring with different mediums.  In 2011 I was diagnosed with an aggressive metastatic cancer and told my chances were slim.  I bet the odds and am now in remission and as such I decided I no longer wanted to be stressed in a job I didn’t enjoy anymore.  I realised life is really too short to put my dreams on hold. I quit my job and the financial security that came with it and took a big risk to study art in 2015 part time.  I had hoped I would gain employment on the days off, so if you are looking for a creative and artistic person part time, let me know!  However for now, I am still a broke student without an income and any spare time I do have, I am exploring, experimenting and creating. Who am I? I am broke but very happy!
            I am enjoying exploring with different mediums such as textiles, painting, drawing, sculpture, and jewellery.  I discovered I have a love/hate relationship with 2D and have found a challenge and passion in 3D, particularly sculpture and jewellery.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have exhibited at Odlin Gallery and The Learning Connexion where I gained People’s Choice Award.  I had two bronze sculptures selected and exhibited at both The Muriel Hopper Art Awards 2017 and also at The Wellington Regional Art Awards 2016. I have been involved with Artist on Display on Main Street, Upper Hutt and have gained Accreditation as a Paverpol Instructor and run regular workshops and attend artisan markets regularly.
